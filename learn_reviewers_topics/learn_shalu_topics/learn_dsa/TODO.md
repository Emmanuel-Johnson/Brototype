- Quicksort time complexity 
- Time complexity – needs improvement 
- Why mergesort is best for linked list 
- Collision handling methods 
- Rehashing 
- Minimum spanning tree 
- AVL tree 
- Linear probing implementation 
- Doubly linked list insertion operation 
- insert a node in witha a value in doubly linked list on specified index.(write only the logic).
- hash table with leniar probing for handlign collesion.
- doubly ll insertion logic - needs improvement
- time complexity of quicksort
- minimum spanning tree
