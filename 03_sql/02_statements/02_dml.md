# DML (Data Manipulation Language)

## What is DML?

DML (Data Manipulation Language) is a category of SQL commands used to work with the actual data stored inside database tables. It focuses on inserting, modifying, removing, and retrieving rows.

## Main DML Commands

### INSERT

Used to add new rows into a table.
Examples include inserting a new user or order record.

### UPDATE

Used to modify existing data in a table.
Common uses include changing a user’s email or updating an order status.

### DELETE

Used to remove specific rows from a table.
Typically used with a WHERE clause to delete targeted records such as inactive users.

### SELECT

Used to retrieve data from one or more tables.
It is commonly used for fetching users, orders, reports, and analytics data.

## Key Interview Point

DML operations are transaction-controlled, meaning they can be committed or rolled back using TCL commands.
