# DCL (Data Control Language)

## What is DCL?

DCL (Data Control Language) is a category of SQL commands used to control access and permissions in a database. It defines who can perform specific actions on database objects such as tables, schemas, and views.

## Main DCL Commands

### GRANT

Used to give specific permissions to a user or role.
Common permissions include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE on database objects.

### REVOKE

Used to remove previously granted permissions from a user or role.
It is commonly used to restrict access when roles or security requirements change.

## Key Interview Point

DCL is mainly used by database administrators and system admins, and its commands affect security and access control rather than data or database structure.
