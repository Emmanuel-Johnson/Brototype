A class property in Python is a clean, Pythonic way to control how an attribute of an object is accessed, modified, or deleted, without changing how the user interacts with it. Instead of calling separate getter and setter methods, Python provides the @property decorator, which allows us to attach logic—like validation, calculations, or access restrictions—to a normal-looking attribute. Internally, we store the real value in a protected variable like _age, and the property acts like a smart gatekeeper: the getter runs when we read the attribute, the setter runs when we assign a value, and the deleter runs when we delete it. This gives us encapsulation, prevents invalid data, lets us create read-only or computed attributes, and allows us to change internal implementation later without breaking the external API. In short, properties make code cleaner, safer, and more maintainable while still keeping a simple attribute-style interface.
