"In Python, a class can have three types of methods: instance methods, class methods, and static methods. An instance method is the most common type and takes self as the first argument, meaning it works with data belonging to a specific object. A class method uses the @classmethod decorator and takes cls as its first argument, allowing it to access or modify class-level data; it’s mainly used for factory methods or alternative constructors that create objects in different ways. A static method uses @staticmethod and takes no implicit self or cls parameter—it's simply a utility function placed inside a class for logical grouping, and it cannot access or modify class or instance data. In short: use instance methods when working with object data, classmethods when working with class-level data or creating objects, and staticmethods for general helper functions like validations or calculations."
