A class in Python is like a blueprint or recipe used to create objects that share similar properties and behaviors. It helps organize code by grouping data (called attributes) and functions (called methods) together. For example, a Car class can define attributes like brand and color, and methods like drive. When we create real objects from this blueprint—like a red Ferrari or a blue Honda—we call them instances. The special init method (constructor) runs when an object is created and sets its initial values, and the keyword self refers to the specific object being worked on. Python classes also support inheritance, where one class can reuse or modify the features of another class, and encapsulation, where sensitive data can be protected using prefixes like __ (double underscore). Overall, classes make code cleaner, reusable, and easier to maintain by modeling real-world things in a structured way.
