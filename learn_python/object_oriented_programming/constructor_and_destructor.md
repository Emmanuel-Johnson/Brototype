In Python, a constructor is a special method called __init__() that runs automatically whenever an object is created, and its job is to initialize the object’s attributes and set it into a valid starting state; the first parameter is always self, which refers to the current object. The actual object is created by __new__(), but __init__() is what we use 99% of the time for initialization. A destructor, on the other hand, is a method called __del__() that runs when an object is about to be destroyed, but unlike constructors, destructors are not guaranteed to run immediately because Python uses automatic garbage collection. Since Python manages memory on its own, destructors are rarely used, except when cleaning up external resources like files, database connections, or network sockets. In simple terms, __init__() sets up the object when it's born, __del__() handles cleanup when it dies, and destructors are used only for resource cleanup, not memory management.
