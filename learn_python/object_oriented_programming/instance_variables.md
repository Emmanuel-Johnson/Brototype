"Instance variables in Python are variables that belong to individual objects of a class, meaning each object has its own separate copy of these variables. They are created inside the __init__ constructor using the self keyword, where self refers to the specific object being created. Instance variables store data that changes from object to object—for example, two Student objects can have different names and ages because each object keeps its own instance variable values. This makes them different from class variables, which are defined outside methods and shared by all objects, and also different from local variables, which exist only inside a method and disappear after the method finishes. Instance variables exist as long as the object exists and are essential for representing unique characteristics of each object, such as balance in a bank account or color in a car. In short, instance variables allow every object created from the same class to maintain its own independent data."
