In Python, an iterator is an object that allows sequential access to elements, one item at a time, without needing to load the entire collection into memory. It follows the iterator protocol, which requires two methods: __iter__() that returns the iterator object, and __next__() that returns the next value and raises StopIteration when the sequence ends. Iterables like lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries become iterators when passed to iter(), and the next() function is used to fetch items one by one. Python’s for loop internally relies on this protocol — it repeatedly calls next() and stops automatically when StopIteration is raised. Iterators provide major advantages such as memory efficiency through lazy evaluation, support for infinite sequences, and maintaining state between iterations. We can also define custom iterators by implementing the protocol in a class. Overall, iterators make Python’s looping, streaming, and data-processing operations consistent, efficient, and scalable.
