“The match statement, introduced in Python 3.10, is a modern structural pattern-matching feature that works like a smarter, more powerful version of switch-case. Unlike if-elif chains that only check conditions, match can inspect both the value and the structure of data—such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries—and even automatically unpack elements. It evaluates an expression once and runs the first case pattern that matches, with _ used as the default case. It makes code far cleaner and more readable when handling complex data like API responses, commands, or nested structures, and supports features like OR patterns (|), type matching (int()), and guards using if. While its performance is better mainly for structural matching, its real advantage is readability and maintainability, which is why it's preferred over long if-else chains when dealing with structured data.”
