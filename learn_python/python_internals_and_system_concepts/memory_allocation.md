“In Python, memory allocation is fully automatic and handled by the Python Memory Manager, which stores all objects in a private heap. Python uses two main areas: the stack for function calls and local variables, and the heap for actual objects like lists, dictionaries, and user-defined classes. The primary mechanism for memory management is reference counting, where every object tracks how many references point to it—when the count becomes zero, the object is immediately deleted. However, reference counting cannot clean circular references, so Python also uses a garbage collector to detect and remove such unused cyclic objects. Internally, Python optimizes memory using arenas (256 KB), pools (4 KB), and blocks to efficiently reuse memory, and it even performs interning for small immutable objects like integers from -5 to 256 for faster access and lower memory use. Overall, Python's memory allocation system is automatic, efficient, and optimized through reference counting, garbage collection, and intelligent internal memory structures.”
