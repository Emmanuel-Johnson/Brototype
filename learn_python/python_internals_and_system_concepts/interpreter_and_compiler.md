Python is often called an interpreted language, but the correct answer is that Python uses a hybrid model: it is both compiled and interpreted. When you run a Python program, CPython (the default Python implementation) first compiles your .py file into bytecode, a platform-independent intermediate form stored in .pyc files inside __pycache__; this stage catches all syntax errors like missing colons or wrong indentation. After this, the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) interprets the bytecode line by line, converting it into machine instructions during execution—this is where runtime errors like division by zero occur. Because of this two-step process, Python is easy to debug and platform-independent like compiled languages, but slower than languages like C++ that compile directly to machine code. In short: Python compiles to bytecode automatically, then the PVM interprets that bytecode, giving Python the combined advantages of portability, simplicity, and quick development.
