"Loops in Python are control-flow structures that allow me to execute a block of code repeatedly without writing it multiple times, making my programs cleaner, more efficient, and easier to maintain. Python provides two primary types of loops: the for loop, which is ideal when I know exactly how many times I need to iterate or when I'm working through a sequence like a list, string, or range; and the while loop, which continues running as long as a specified condition remains true, making it useful when the number of iterations isn’t predetermined. I also use control statements like break to exit a loop early, continue to skip the current iteration, and pass as a placeholder when I need syntactically valid but empty code blocks. In real projects, I frequently use for loops for iteration, data processing, and traversing collections, and while loops for condition-driven workflows like input validation or search operations. I’m comfortable with nested loops when solving multi-dimensional problems, and I understand that break and continue only affect the innermost loop. Loops also integrate well with Python data structures—for example, looping over dictionaries using .keys(), .values(), or .items() for more expressive control. Overall, I choose loop types based on readability, performance, and clarity, ensuring that my code avoids infinite loops, remains structured, and follows Pythonic best practices."
