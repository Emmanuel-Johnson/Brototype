"break, continue, and pass are control-flow statements in Python that help manage how loops behave. The break statement is used to immediately exit a loop when a certain condition is met, which is useful in real-world scenarios like searching for an item and stopping as soon as it’s found rather than wasting time checking the rest of the data. The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the current iteration and jumps directly to the next iteration of the loop, making it ideal for filtering—such as ignoring invalid or negative values while still processing the rest of the list. The pass statement, unlike the other two, does nothing; it’s simply a placeholder used when Python requires a statement syntactically but you don’t want to execute any code yet, such as when defining empty functions, classes, or conditional blocks during development. Together, these three statements help improve loop efficiency, maintain clean control flow, and enable proper code structuring. break stops the loop, continue skips an iteration, and pass silently does nothing—each serving a distinct purpose in writing clear, optimized, and maintainable Python code."
