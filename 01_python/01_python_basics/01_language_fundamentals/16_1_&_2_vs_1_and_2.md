1 & 2 uses the bitwise AND (&) operator, which works on the binary (bit-level) representation of numbers. Here, 1 is 01 in binary and 2 is 10. Bitwise AND compares each bit position and returns 1 only if both bits are 1. Since there is no position where both have 1, the result becomes 00, which is 0. Bitwise operators like & are mainly used for low-level tasks such as bit masking, flags, and performance-oriented logic.

In Python, and and or use short-circuit evaluation, meaning they check values from left to right and stop as soon as the result is known. For and, Python returns the first falsy value it finds; if none are falsy, it returns the last value, so 1 and 2 returns 2 because 1 is truthy. For or, Python returns the first truthy value it finds; if none are truthy, it returns the last value, so 1 or 2 returns 1 because 1 is already truthy. This is why and and or don’t always return True or False, but instead return one of the actual operands.
