== and is in Python look similar but do different things: == checks value equality, meaning it compares whether two objects have the same data or content, while is checks identity, meaning it compares whether both variables point to the exact same object in memory. Python keeps value and memory location separate, so two different objects can store the same value (== is True) but still be different objects (is is False). You should use == when you want to compare values like numbers, strings, or lists, and use is when you want to check identity, especially for singletons like None, True, or False (for example, x is None).
