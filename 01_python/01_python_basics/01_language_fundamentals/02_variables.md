In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a value stored in memory, used to hold data so it can be reused and modified throughout a program; we need variables to make code readable, flexible, and dynamic instead of hard-coding values again and again, which is especially important for calculations, conditions, loops, and user input. Variables in Python are created automatically when a value is assigned using =, and Python decides the data type at runtime, so there is no need to declare types explicitly (this is called dynamic typing). A variable does not store the value itself but references the object in memory, and its value can be changed at any time by assigning a new one, making Python variables simple to use yet powerful for building real-world applications.
