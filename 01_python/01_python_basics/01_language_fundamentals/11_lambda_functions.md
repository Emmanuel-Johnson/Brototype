A lambda function is a small, anonymous function in Python.
“Anonymous” means it doesn’t have a name (unless you assign it to a variable). It can take any number of arguments, but it can have only one expression, and that expression’s result is automatically returned. We use lambda functions when we need a short, simple function for a short time. They make code shorter and cleaner, especially when passing a function as an argument (like in map(), filter(), or sorted()). Instead of defining a full function with def, lambda lets us write the logic in one line. A lambda function works by taking input values on the left side and applying a single expression on the right side. The keyword lambda tells Python that this is a small, anonymous function. After the colon, you write one expression, and Python automatically evaluates that expression and returns the result. You don’t need to use the def keyword, a function name, or a return statement. When the lambda function is called, the provided arguments are substituted into the expression, the expression is executed, and the result is immediately returned.
