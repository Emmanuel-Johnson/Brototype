A pure function in Python is a function that always produces the same output for the same input and does not affect or depend on anything outside itself. It only uses the values passed as arguments and simply returns a result, without modifying global variables, printing output, reading input, or changing files. Because of this behavior, pure functions are predictable, easy to test, easy to reuse, and less likely to introduce bugs. They are commonly used in functional programming and are ideal for writing clean and reliable logic.

An impure function, on the other hand, either depends on external state or causes side effects such as modifying global variables, printing to the console, reading user input, or interacting with databases and APIs. This means the same input may produce different outputs at different times. While impure functions are necessary for real-world tasks, they are harder to test and debug compared to pure functions. In simple terms, if a function only works with its inputs and returns a value, it is pure; if it touches or changes anything outside itself, it is impure.
