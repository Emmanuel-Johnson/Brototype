In Python, functions are often classified as pure or impure based on how they behave with inputs, outputs, and external state. Understanding this difference helps write predictable, testable, and maintainable code.

A pure function is a function that always returns the same output for the same input and does not cause any side effects. This means it does not modify global variables, does not change input arguments, and does not interact with things outside the function like files, databases, user input, or printing to the console. Because of this, pure functions are easy to test, debug, and reason about. For example, a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum is pure, because the result depends only on the inputs and nothing else.

On the other hand, an impure function is a function that depends on or modifies external state or causes side effects. Side effects include printing output, modifying global variables, updating a list passed as an argument, reading from or writing to a file, or using system time or random values. Because impure functions rely on external factors, calling them with the same input can produce different outputs at different times, which makes them harder to test and debug.

To put it simply, pure functions are predictable, while impure functions are situational. If a function reads a global variable, updates a database, logs data, or prints something, it is impure. If a function just takes inputs, processes them, and returns a result without touching anything else, it is pure.

In real-world Python applications, both pure and impure functions are necessary. Pure functions are ideal for business logic, calculations, and data transformations. Impure functions are unavoidable when dealing with real systems like user input, APIs, files, or databases. A good practice is to keep most of your logic pure and isolate impurity at the edges of your application.
