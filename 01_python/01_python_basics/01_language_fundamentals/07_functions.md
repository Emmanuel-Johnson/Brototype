A function in Python is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task and is defined using the def keyword; it can accept inputs called parameters and can return an output using return. Functions are used to avoid repeating code, make programs cleaner and more organized, and break large problems into smaller, manageable parts that are easier to understand and maintain. You create a function by defining it with a name and parameters, writing the logic inside it, and then calling it by its name with required arguments, at which point Python executes the function’s code and gives back the result if specified.
