In Python, the for–else pattern is a special control flow feature where an else block is attached directly to a for loop. The else block executes only if the loop completes all its iterations normally, meaning without encountering a break statement. If a break occurs at any point inside the loop, the else block is skipped. This behavior often surprises beginners, but it is very useful once understood clearly.

The key idea to remember is that the else does not belong to the if statement inside the loop; it belongs to the loop itself. Python uses the else block to indicate that the loop was not terminated prematurely. In simple terms, if the loop finishes without breaking, the else part runs; if the loop breaks, it does not.

This pattern is commonly used in searching and validation scenarios. For example, when searching for an element in a list, the loop checks each item. If the target is found, the loop breaks immediately. If the loop finishes checking all items and never breaks, the else block runs, which can handle the “not found” case. This removes the need for extra flag variables and makes the code cleaner and more readable.

Another common use case is checking for prime numbers. The loop tries to divide the number by all possible values. If a divisor is found, the loop breaks, indicating the number is not prime. If no divisor is found and the loop completes normally, the else block runs, confirming the number is prime. This logic directly matches the meaning of the problem, which is why for–else is considered very Pythonic.

It is also important to note that continue statements do not affect the else block. Only a break statement prevents the else block from executing. The for–else pattern also works with while loops and follows the same rule: the else block runs only when the loop ends naturally.

In summary, the for–else pattern in Python allows the else block to run only when the loop completes without a break. It is mainly used for search, validation, and verification logic, helps avoid unnecessary flags, and improves code clarity.
