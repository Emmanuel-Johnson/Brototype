The for–else pattern in Python means an else block attached to a for loop, where the else runs only if the loop finishes normally, that is, without hitting a break. It’s mainly used when searching for something in a loop: if the item is found, the loop breaks; if the loop completes and no break occurs, the else block clearly handles the “not found” case without using extra flags or variables. Python internally tracks whether the loop was exited using break; if no break happens, it executes else, otherwise it skips it. The while–else pattern works the same way: the else block executes only when the while loop’s condition becomes false naturally, and it is skipped if the loop is terminated early using break.
