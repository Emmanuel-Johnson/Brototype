In Python, every value is automatically treated as either truthy or falsy when used in conditions like if or while. Falsy values include False, None, 0, 0.0, empty strings (""), and empty collections like [], {}, and (), while all other values are truthy. This behavior exists to make code cleaner and more readable by allowing direct checks instead of explicit comparisons, such as writing if my_list: instead of if len(my_list) > 0. Internally, Python evaluates this using bool(value), so empty or zero values become False and non-empty or non-zero values become True, which is commonly used for checking user input, validating data, and providing default values in a concise way.
