Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in a program by executing different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false; they mainly use if, elif, and else. We use them so a program can react differently in different situations, such as checking age eligibility, validating user input, controlling application flow, or handling permissions in Django views. They work by evaluating conditions written with comparison or logical operators, and Python uses indentation to define the code blocks; the if statement checks the first condition, elif checks additional conditions if needed, and else runs when none of the conditions are true, with Python executing only the first matching block.
