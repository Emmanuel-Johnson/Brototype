An array in Python is a collection of multiple values stored under a single variable name, where each value can be accessed using an index starting from zero; in practice, Python mostly uses lists as arrays. We need arrays because they let us store, manage, and process related data together—making code cleaner, shorter, and easier to loop through instead of using many separate variables. Arrays are especially useful when working with repeated data like numbers, names, or results. In Python, arrays (lists) are created using square brackets [], elements are separated by commas, and you can access, update, add, or remove elements using indexing and built-in methods, making them flexible and powerful for everyday programming tasks.
