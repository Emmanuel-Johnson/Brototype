Python is a high-level, interpreted, dynamically typed, and platform-independent programming language known for its simple and readable syntax, which makes it easy to learn and fast to develop applications. It supports multiple programming paradigms such as object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming, allowing flexible and scalable design. Python provides automatic memory management through garbage collection, reducing memory-related errors, and comes with a large standard library along with a vast third-party ecosystem that supports web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more. Its interpreted nature enables easy debugging and rapid prototyping, while platform independence allows the same code to run on different operating systems. However, Python can be slower compared to compiled languages and offers less control over memory, but its productivity, versatility, and strong community support make it one of the most popular and widely used programming languages today.
