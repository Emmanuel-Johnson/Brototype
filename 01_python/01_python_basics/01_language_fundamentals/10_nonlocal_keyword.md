The nonlocal keyword in Python is used inside a nested (inner) function to indicate that a variable comes from the nearest enclosing (outer) function, not from the inner function itself or the global scope. By default, assigning a value inside a function creates a local variable, but nonlocal allows the inner function to modify a variable defined in the outer function. This is useful when you want inner functions to share and update state from their enclosing function, such as in closures or counters. The variable must already exist in the outer function; otherwise, Python raises an error.
