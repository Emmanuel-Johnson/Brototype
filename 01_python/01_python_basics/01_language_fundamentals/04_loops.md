Loops in Python are control structures that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true or for each item in a collection; Python mainly provides for loops (used to iterate over sequences like lists, strings, ranges, etc.) and while loops (used to repeat code until a condition becomes false). Loops are used to avoid writing the same code again and again, making programs shorter, cleaner, and easier to maintain; they are essential when working with repetitive tasks such as processing lists of data, running counters, validating input, or performing operations multiple times dynamically. In Python, a for loop works by taking each element from an iterable and executing the code block once per element, while a while loop keeps running the code block as long as its condition evaluates to True; both loops can be controlled using keywords like break (to stop the loop), continue (to skip the current iteration), and else (to run code when the loop finishes normally).
