In Python, a dictionary is a built-in, mutable data structure used to store data as key-value pairs. You can think of it like a real-world dictionary — you look up a word (the key) to get its meaning (the value). Dictionaries allow fast data retrieval because they’re implemented using hash tables internally, which means accessing a value by key is, on average, an O(1) time operation.

You create a dictionary using curly braces, for example: user = {"name": "Anna", "age": 25}. Keys must be immutable types — like strings, numbers, or tuples — and must be unique. Values, however, can be anything: numbers, strings, lists, even other dictionaries. Dictionaries are mutable, so you can add, update, or remove entries anytime. Common operations include dict["name"] to access a value, dict.get("name") to avoid a KeyError, dict["age"] = 26 to update, .keys(), .values(), and .items() to iterate, and .pop() or .clear() to delete.

Dictionaries maintain insertion order (as of Python 3.7+), which means entries stay in the same order you insert them. They’re extremely common in Python because they perfectly model structured data — for example, representing JSON responses from APIs, configuration settings, database-like records, or mapping relationships. They’re also used inside many Python internals — for example, a function’s namespace is stored in a dictionary.

In short, dictionaries are one of the most flexible and powerful Python collections — ideal when you need to map one thing to another and access values quickly by a meaningful key instead of by numeric position.
