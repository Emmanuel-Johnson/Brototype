# Data Structures & Algorithms 

#### Learn the following concepts.
* Data Structure & Algorithms
* Memory Allocation and Memory leak
* Complexity Analysis, The complexity of common operations of all data structures should be covered
* Asymptotic analysis (Big-O notation)
* Array
* Linked list
   * Construction of Singly linked list & Doubly linked list
   * Convert array to a linked list
   * Add a node at the end & beginning
   * Delete node with the value specified
   * Insert a node after & before a node with x data
   * Print all elements by order & reverse by order
   * Write a program to remove duplicates in a sorted singly linked list
* String
   * Write a function to replace each alphabet in the given string with another alphabet occurring at the n-th position from each of them
* Linear Search & Binary Search
* Recursion
* Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick sort and Merge sort
* Stack and Queue
   * PUSH, POP and Display elements in Stack 
   * Enqueue, Dequeue and Display elements in Queue
* Hash Table
* Tree
* Binary Search Tree
   * Create a Binary Search Tree with insertion, contains, delete, three traversals (postorder, preorder, in order)
   * Find the closest value to a given number in a Tree
   * Validate whether a given tree is BST or not
* Heap
   * Create a min heap & max heap with build, insert, remove
* Heap sort
* Trie 
* Graph
   * Graph traversals (BFS, DFS)
* Applications of all structures
