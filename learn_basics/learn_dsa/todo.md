# Data Structures & Algorithms 

1. Core DSA Fundamentals

* Data Structure & Algorithms
* Memory Allocation and Memory leak
* Complexity Analysis, The complexity of common operations of all data structures should be covered
* Asymptotic analysis (Big-O notation)
* how time and space complexity calculated
* asynotations-worst case - which notation?
* What are the common time complexities?
* logN

2. Arrays & Strings

* Array
* Jagged array
* String
* Write a function to replace each alphabet in the given string with another alphabet occurring at the n-th position from each of them

3. Linked List

* Construction of Singly linked list & Doubly linked list
* Convert array to a linked list
* Add a node at the end & beginning
* Delete node with the value specified
* Insert a node after & before a node with x data
* Print all elements by order & reverse by order
* Write a program to remove duplicates in a sorted singly linked list
* diff types of linked list and their differences
* What is the time complexity to insert an element at the end of a linked list?
* time complexity of adding element into linked list

4. Searching

* Linear Search & Binary Search

5. Recursion

* Recursion
* what is base case in recursion?

6. Sorting Algorithms

* Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick sort and Merge sort
* Quick Sort time complexity
* best case time complexity of quicksort.
* What is the best time complexity of insertion sort and quick sort?
* What is the time complexity of merge sort?
* explian binary search and merge sort and quick sort with complexity

7. Stack

* Stack and Queue
* PUSH, POP and Display elements in Stack
* if we insert in stack - in which position the element is inserted
* if we delete in stack - position of element deleted
* what is stack overflow?
* underflow in stack
* min stack
* sort a stack using temporary stack

8. Queue

* Enqueue, Dequeue and Display elements in Queue
* What is a circular queue?
* priority queue

9. Hashing

* Hash Table
* collisions, how it's handled
* collision and its handling
* Give real-life examples of hash tables.
* hash function exact concept
* what is load factor, threshold value.
* rehashing
* applications of hash table
* types of hash functions

10. Trees

* Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* Create a Binary Search Tree with insertion, contains, delete, three traversals (postorder, preorder, in order)
* Find the closest value to a given number in a Tree
* Validate whether a given tree is BST or not
* bt vs bst
* tree traversal - preorder - explanation
* Create a binary tree and calculate the height of the tree
* What is an AVL tree?

11. Heap

* Create a min heap & max heap with build, insert, remove
* Heap sort
* Heapify exact concept
* what is heapify explain with complexity

12. Trie

* Trie

13. Graphs
