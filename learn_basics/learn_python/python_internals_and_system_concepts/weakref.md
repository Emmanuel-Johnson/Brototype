Weakref in Python simply means a “non-owning reference” to an object — it points to an object without keeping it alive. Normally, when you store an object in a variable, Python increases its reference count and will not delete it until all references are gone. But a weak reference does not increase this count, so if no strong references exist, the object is still deleted, even if a weakref points to it. This helps avoid memory leaks, especially in circular references (like two objects pointing to each other), and is useful in caches or observer patterns where you don't want objects to stay in memory forever. Python’s weakref module provides weakref.ref(), proxy(), WeakSet, WeakKeyDictionary, and WeakValueDictionary — all of which automatically remove entries when the original object is deleted. In short: weakref lets you refer to an object without preventing garbage collection, helping Python manage memory more efficiently.
