"In Python, operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations on values, and they are classified by how many operands they work with. Unary operators operate on a single operand—for example, the unary minus (-x), logical not, and bitwise complement (~x). Binary operators work on two operands and are the most common category, including arithmetic operators like +, -, *, /; comparison operators like == and <; logical operators such as and and or; assignment operators like += and -=; and bitwise operators like &, |, and ^. Python also supports a ternary operator, known as the conditional expression, written as value_if_true if condition else value_if_false, which allows concise conditional assignment. Beyond arity, Python includes identity operators (is, is not) for checking whether two variables refer to the same object in memory, and membership operators (in, not in) for checking whether a value exists in a collection. Understanding operator precedence is important because it determines how complex expressions are evaluated—for example, exponentiation has higher precedence than multiplication, which has higher precedence than addition. In practical development, these operators are essential for performing calculations, controlling logic, handling data structures, and writing expressive, readable Python code."
