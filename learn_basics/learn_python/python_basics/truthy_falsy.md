"In Python, every value has an inherent boolean interpretation, meaning it behaves as either truthy or falsy when evaluated in conditions like if statements. Truthy values are those that evaluate to True in a boolean context—typically anything that is non-empty, non-zero, or meaningful, such as non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, lists, dictionaries, or any object instance. Falsy values are a small, well-defined set of values that evaluate to False: None, False, zero of any numeric type (0, 0.0, 0j), and all empty containers like '', [], (), {}, set(), and range(0). Instead of writing explicit checks like len(my_list) > 0, Python allows cleaner code by relying on truthiness—for example, if my_list: is enough to check if a list has items. The bool() function can be used to test how Python interprets any value. At a deeper level, custom classes can control their truthiness by implementing bool() or, if that is missing, len(). Understanding truthy and falsy values helps write Pythonic, concise code, especially when using logical operators like and and or, which return values based on truthiness rather than strict booleans. Overall, truthy and falsy behavior is a core Python concept that simplifies conditional logic and makes code more expressive and readable."
