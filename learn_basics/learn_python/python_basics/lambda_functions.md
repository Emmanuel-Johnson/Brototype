"A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword, designed for situations where I need a simple, one-line function without formally declaring it using def. Lambda functions can take any number of arguments but can only contain one expression, making them perfect for short, throwaway operations that don’t require multiple steps or complex logic. I commonly use lambda functions with higher-order functions like map(), filter(), sorted(), and reduce(), where they act as inline callbacks—for example, doubling every number in a list using map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers) or sorting a list of dictionaries using sorted(data, key=lambda item: item['age']). The key strength of lambda functions is conciseness and convenience, but their limitation is readability and their ability to handle only a single expression, so for more complex logic or reusable operations, I prefer regular functions defined with def."
