"Variables in Python are names that reference objects stored in memory, and understanding how they work is essential for writing predictable and efficient code. Python uses dynamic typing, so a variable’s type is determined at runtime, allowing me to assign values directly like name = 'John' or age = 25 without declaring a data type. Internally, variables store references to objects rather than the objects themselves, which becomes especially important with mutable types such as lists and dictionaries because assigning list2 = list1 points both names to the same underlying object. I follow PEP 8 naming conventions—using descriptive snake_case names, avoiding keywords, and keeping variable names meaningful to improve code readability in team environments. While Python allows reassignment of different types to the same variable, I maintain consistent types in professional code to prevent hidden bugs and confusion. Variables can reference any object in Python, including functions, since everything is treated as an object. I’m also careful about the difference between mutable and immutable objects: mutables can change in place, while immutables create new objects on modification, which affects behavior when passing variables into functions. I use features like multiple assignment and unpacking—such as x, y = 1, 2—not just for convenience but to write clean, Pythonic code. Finally, I pay attention to variable scope; I prefer using local variables within functions for clarity and testability, and only modify global variables intentionally using the global keyword. Overall, I treat variables as a key part of designing clean, maintainable Python programs."
