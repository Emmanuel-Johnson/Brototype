Super() in Python is a built-in function that allows a child class to call and reuse methods from its parent class, mainly used inside __init__ to ensure the parent’s initialization runs before the child adds its own attributes. It helps avoid repeating code (follows the DRY principle), supports clean inheritance, and works according to Python’s Method Resolution Order (MRO), which means in multi-level or multiple inheritance, Python automatically knows which parent method to call next. Using super() is preferred over directly calling the parent class because it’s more flexible, easier to maintain, and handles complex inheritance correctly. In simple terms, super() lets a subclass say, “Parent class, do your part first, then I’ll extend it,” making the code cleaner, reusable, and professional.
