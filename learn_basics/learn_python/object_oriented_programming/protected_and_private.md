“In Python, access control is handled through naming conventions rather than strict access modifiers like in Java. A public member (no underscore) is accessible from anywhere. A protected member (single underscore, like _marks) is meant for internal use and for subclasses, even though Python still technically allows external access — it's just a convention that says ‘don’t touch this from outside.’ A private member (double underscore, like __salary) triggers name mangling, where Python automatically renames it internally to _ClassName__attribute. This prevents accidental access and avoids naming conflicts during inheritance. Although private members can still be accessed using their mangled names, the intention is to strongly discourage direct use. We usually expose private data safely using getter and setter methods to maintain encapsulation, add validation, and protect data integrity. In short: _ is a soft protection for subclasses, __ is stronger protection using name mangling, and both help achieve proper encapsulation in Python.”
