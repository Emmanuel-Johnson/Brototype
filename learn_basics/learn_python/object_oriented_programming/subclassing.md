Subclassing in Python means creating a new class (child) that inherits properties and methods from an existing class (parent), which helps in code reuse, building hierarchies, and achieving polymorphism. For example, if you have a parent class Animal, you can create subclasses like Dog and Cat that automatically get the parent’s features but can also override methods to provide their own behavior—like a Dog overriding make_sound() to return “Woof!”. A subclass can also use super() to call the parent’s constructor or methods, which is important when the parent class performs essential initialization. Subclassing supports clean design because it follows the “IS-A” relationship—like a Dog is an Animal. Python also uses Method Resolution Order (MRO) to decide which parent’s method to call, especially in cases of multiple inheritance. Overall, subclassing allows code reuse, customization through overriding, clean structure using inheritance, and flexibility through polymorphism, making it one of the core OOP concepts in Python.
