In Python, an object is simply an instance of a class, and it represents a real-world entity with both data (called attributes) and behavior (called methods). A class works like a blueprint, and every object created from it has its own independent data. For example, if a class Car defines attributes like make and model and a method like drive(), then creating an object such as my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla") gives you a specific car with its own values. In Python, everything is an object, including integers, strings, lists, and even functions. Objects use the self keyword to refer to themselves internally, allowing each object to maintain its own state. They also connect directly to core OOP principles—they encapsulate data and behavior together, support inheritance, enable polymorphism where methods behave differently across classes, and provide abstraction by hiding internal complexity. Objects may also have instance variables (unique to each object) and class variables (shared across all objects). Understanding objects is important because Python follows a heavily object-oriented design, where creating, using, and manipulating objects forms the basis of how programs are structured and executed.
