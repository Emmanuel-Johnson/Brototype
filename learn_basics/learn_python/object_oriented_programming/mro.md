MRO (Method Resolution Order) in Python is the order in which Python searches for methods and attributes when you call them on an object, especially in inheritance. When a class inherits from one or more parent classes, Python follows this specific order to avoid confusion, especially in multiple inheritance and the diamond problem. You can view this order using Class.__mro__ or Class.mro(). Python calculates MRO using the C3 Linearization Algorithm, which follows three rules: child before parents, left-to-right order of inheritance, and consistent ordering. MRO ensures that Python always knows which method to call first, and it works closely with the super() function, which moves to the next class in the MRO. This helps avoid duplicate calls and makes multiple inheritance predictable and conflict-free.
