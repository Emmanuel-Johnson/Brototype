Magic methods in Python, also called dunder methods, are special double-underscore methods (like __init__, __str__, __add__) that Python automatically calls to control how objects behave with built-in operations. They let us customize object creation (__new__, __init__), string representation (__str__ for users, __repr__ for developers), comparisons (__eq__, __lt__), arithmetic (__add__, __sub__), container behavior (__len__, __getitem__), iteration (__iter__, __next__), callable objects (__call__), and context managers (__enter__, __exit__). For example, when we print an object, Python calls __str__, and when we do obj1 + obj2, Python calls __add__. These methods make custom classes behave like built-in types, improve code readability, and support features like operator overloading, iteration with for loops, and automatic resource management with with statements. A clear example is implementing __iter__ and __next__ to make a class iterable, or using __enter__/__exit__ to ensure resources are cleaned up safely. Overall, magic methods help create clean, Pythonic, and intuitive object-oriented designs.
