A closure in Python is a function with memory—it’s a nested function that remembers the values from its enclosing scope even after the outer function has finished executing. A closure is created when three conditions are met: there is an inner function, that inner function uses variables from the outer function, and the outer function returns the inner one. This allows the returned function to maintain state across calls without using global variables. Closures are commonly used to create function factories, counters, data encapsulation, callbacks, and even form the foundation of decorators. We can inspect what a closure remembers using the __closure__ attribute, and modify outer variables using the nonlocal keyword. In simple terms, a closure is a powerful way to keep data private and preserve state inside a function.
