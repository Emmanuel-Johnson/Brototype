A context manager in Python is a construct that helps manage resources automatically by handling setup and cleanup using the with statement, so you don’t have to manually open/close or acquire/release resources. It works through two special methods: __enter__() which runs when the with block starts (for example opening a file or acquiring a lock), and __exit__() which runs when the block ends—even if an exception occurs—to clean up resources (like closing files, releasing locks, or rolling back database transactions). This prevents resource leaks and makes code safer and cleaner than using try/finally. Context managers can be created using a class with __enter__ and __exit__, or using the @contextmanager decorator where code before yield acts like setup and code after yield acts like cleanup. In __exit__, Python also passes exception details, and returning True suppresses the exception while returning False lets it propagate. We commonly use context managers for file handling, database transactions, thread locks, timers, and temporary resources. Overall, they make resource management automatic, reliable, and Pythonic.
