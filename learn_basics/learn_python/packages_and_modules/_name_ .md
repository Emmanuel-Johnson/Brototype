In Python, __name__ is a special built-in variable that tells whether a file is being run directly or imported as a module. When you run a file directly, Python sets __name__ to "__main__", but when the file is imported, __name__ becomes the module’s name. That’s why we use the condition if __name__ == "__main__": — it ensures that certain code (like tests or the main program logic) runs only when the script is executed directly, and not when it is imported somewhere else. This helps keep code clean, reusable, and prevents unwanted execution during imports.
