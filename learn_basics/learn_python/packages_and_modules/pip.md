“Pip is Python’s default package manager used to install and manage external libraries that don’t come built into Python. It connects to the Python Package Index (PyPI), which is an online repository of thousands of ready-made packages, and with simple commands like pip install package_name, it automatically downloads, installs, and configures the packages your project needs. This makes development easier because you don’t have to write everything from scratch—pip handles dependencies, version management, and lets you share project requirements through files like requirements.txt. Overall, pip is essential for real-world Python development as it simplifies adding powerful tools, libraries, and frameworks to your projects.”
