"In Python, a module is simply a single .py file that contains related code such as functions, variables, or classes, while a package is a directory that organizes multiple modules and must contain a special __init__.py file so Python knows to treat that folder as a package. This __init__.py file can be empty or can expose selected functions or modules for easier importing. When we import something (like from utils.helpers import format_date), Python looks for it through the directories listed in sys.path, and once a module is imported, it is cached in sys.modules so repeated imports are faster. In real projects, packages help us structure code cleanly using sub-packages—like api, database, or utils—and we generally prefer absolute imports (recommended by PEP 8) because they are clearer and more maintainable than relative imports. In short: modules are individual files, packages are folders containing modules, and __init__.py is what binds them together into a proper, importable Python package."
