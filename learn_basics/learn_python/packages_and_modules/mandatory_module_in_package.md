"In Python, the mandatory module in a package is the __init__.py file. This file tells Python to treat the directory as a package so that its modules can be imported. Without __init__.py, Python won’t recognize the folder as a proper package, especially in traditional and interview-expected structures. The file can be completely empty or it can contain initialization code such as imports, variables, or an __all__ list to control what gets exposed. In short, __init__.py acts like a label that marks a folder as a package and allows proper package-level importing."
