Dear Emmanuel Johnson,

I hope you’re doing well.

We’re reaching out regarding your progress in the program. Since you were unable to attend the scheduled post-refresh review on 29-Sep-2025 even after our reminders and have already completed a one-month refresh period, you will now be placed on a 6-month cool-off period, starting from 30-Sep-2025.

Please don’t consider this the end; it's simply a break intended to help you regain focus and clarity.

You may attend the post cool-off review at any point during the 6-month period once you feel ready. Multiple attempts are allowed during this time, and each attempt will require a non-refundable fee of ₹2,500. Please note that no review attempts will be permitted after the 6-month period ends.

You are requested to connect with your batch counselor on or before 25-March-2026 to confirm your readiness and willingness to rejoin.

If there is no update within two weeks after the cool-off period ends—or in case you do not attend or clear the mandatory post cool-off review—it will be considered a voluntary withdrawal from the program, and may result in permanent removal of enrollment without further notice.

We encourage you to make the most of this time to upskill, rebuild consistency, and return stronger. If you have any questions or need support, please don’t hesitate to contact your batch counselor.

Please also note that the total course duration, including any refresh or cool-off periods, is 1.5 years.  We strongly encourage you to stay consistent and complete the course as early as possible for the best learning and placement outcomes.

Wishing you the very best in your preparation and continued journey.

Warm regards ,
