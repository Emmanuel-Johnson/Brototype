Django is a **high-level Python web framework** used to build web applications and APIs **quickly, securely, and cleanly**.

👉 In plain English:  
**Django helps you build the backend of a website** — handling data, logic, authentication, and APIs — without reinventing the wheel.

## 🔹 What Django Actually Does

Django takes care of the heavy lifting so you can focus on features.

It helps you:

- Handle HTTP requests & responses  
- Work with databases using Python (ORM)  
- Manage users, login, and permissions  
- Build REST APIs (with Django REST Framework)  
- Secure your app against common attacks  
- Scale apps used by millions of users

## 🔹 How Django Works (Big Picture)

```
Browser / React App
        ↓ HTTP
      Django
        ↓
     Database
```

Django sits on the server, receives requests, processes them, talks to the database, and sends responses back.

## 🔹 Django Follows MTV Architecture

Django uses **MTV**, which is very similar to MVC.

| Django Component | Meaning | What It Does |
|------------------|--------|--------------|
| Model | Data | Database structure & queries |
| Template | UI | HTML / response formatting |
| View | Logic | Handles requests & responses |

👉 Django automatically connects these pieces for you.
