# Static Files vs Media Files in Django

## Static Files

### What Are Static Files?

Static files are files that are **part of your application** and **do not change at runtime**.

### Examples

- CSS files  
- JavaScript files  
- Images (logos, icons)  
- Fonts  

👉 Same files for **all users**

---

### Django Static Files Structure

```text
app/
 └── static/
     └── app/
         ├── style.css
         └── logo.png
```

---

## Media Files

### What Are Media Files?

Media files are files that are **uploaded by users** while the app is running.

### Examples

- Profile pictures  
- Product images  
- Uploaded PDFs  
- Videos  

👉 Different files for **different users**

---

### Django Media Files Structure

```text
media/
 ├── profile_pics/
 ├── product_images/
 └── uploads/
```

---

## Key Differences (Most Important)

| Feature | Static Files | Media Files |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Created by | Developer | User |
| Changes at runtime | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Stored in Git | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Django field | ❌ None | FileField, ImageField |
| Purpose | UI & frontend | User content |

---

## Django Settings Comparison

```python
# Static files
STATIC_URL = "/static/"
```

```python
# Media files
MEDIA_URL = "/media/"
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "media"
```

---

## How Django Treats Them

### Static Files

- Collected using `collectstatic`
- Served by a web server in production
- Not uploaded via forms

---

### Media Files

- Saved to `MEDIA_ROOT`
- Uploaded via forms
- Served by web server or cloud storage

---

## Production Rule (Very Important)

❌ Django should **NOT** serve static or media files in production  
✅ Use **Nginx / Apache / S3 / CDN**

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ Mixing static and media files  
❌ Saving uploads inside the static folder  
❌ Committing media files to Git  
❌ Confusing `STATIC_ROOT` with `MEDIA_ROOT`

---

## Interview One-Liner

**Static files are developer-owned assets; media files are user-uploaded content.**

---

## Quick Summary

- Static = CSS, JS, logos  
- Media = uploads, images, files  
- Static is fixed, media is dynamic  
- Django treats them separately

# Django Static Files & Media Files Configuration

This guide explains the **correct and practical setup** for **MEDIA** and **STATIC** files in Django.

---

## 1️⃣ MEDIA (User‑Uploaded Files)

### Settings (Correct)

```python
MEDIA_URL = "/media/"
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "media"
```

This configuration is **enough for development**, but you must also expose media files via `urls.py`.

---

### urls.py (Development Only)

```python
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # your urls
]

if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(
        settings.MEDIA_URL,
        document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT
    )
```

✅ That’s all you need for **media files in development**.

---

## 2️⃣ STATIC (CSS, JS, Images Shipped With the App)

Having only this is **not enough**:

```python
STATIC_URL = "/static/"
```

---

### Minimum Recommended Setup

```python
STATIC_URL = "/static/"

STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / "static"
]

STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "staticfiles"
```

---

### Why These Settings Exist

- **STATIC_URL**  
  URL prefix used in templates  
  Example: `/static/style.css`

- **STATICFILES_DIRS**  
  Where you keep static files during **development**

- **STATIC_ROOT**  
  Where Django collects **all static files** when you run:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

⚠️ `STATIC_ROOT` is **mandatory in production**.

---

## 3️⃣ Clean & Common Folder Structure

```text
project/
│
├── static/              # your static files (dev)
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── images/
│
├── media/               # user uploads
│
├── staticfiles/         # generated by collectstatic
```

---

## 4️⃣ Quick Rule of Thumb

| Type | Needs URL | Needs ROOT | Needs Extra Config |
|----|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Media | ✅ | ✅ | urls.py mapping |
| Static (dev) | ✅ | ❌ | STATICFILES_DIRS |
| Static (prod) | ✅ | ✅ | collectstatic |

---

## One‑Line Takeaway

- **Media** → what users upload  
- **Static** → what developers ship  
- **Static needs more configuration than media**
