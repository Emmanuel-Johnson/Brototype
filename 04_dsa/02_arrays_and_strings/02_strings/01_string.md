# Strings

## 1. WHAT

A **string** is a data type used to store and manipulate a sequence of characters. It is mainly used to represent text such as names, messages, or input data.

---

## 2. WHY

Strings solve the problem of handling textual data in a structured way. Without strings, working with characters one by one becomes complex, repetitive, and error-prone.

---

## 3. WHERE

Strings are used across **all layers of a system**, including:

* User input handling
* API request–response data
* Database fields
* Data processing and business logic

---

## 4. HOW

* A string stores characters in a sequence
* Operations like access, comparison, or modification are performed using built-in functions
* Each character can be accessed using its position index

---

## 5. WHEN

**Use strings when:**

* Working with text, identifiers, or formatted data

**Do not use strings when:**

* Performing heavy numerical computations
* Frequent character-level mutations are required

---

## 6. EXAMPLE

In a login system, strings are used to store and validate:

* Usernames
* Passwords
* API tokens

---

## 7. PROS & CONS

### Pros ✅

* Easy to use and readable
* Rich set of built-in operations
* Widely supported in all programming languages

### Cons ❌

* Can be memory-heavy
* Inefficient for frequent modifications in many languages

---

## 8. COMMON MISTAKES

* Assuming strings are mutable in all languages
* Inefficient string concatenation inside loops
