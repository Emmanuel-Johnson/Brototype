# 🌳 Tree Terminology (Must-Know)

---

## 1️⃣ Root
- The topmost node  
- Has no parent  
- Entry point of the tree  

## 2️⃣ Node
- Each data element in the tree  

## 3️⃣ Edge
- The connection between two nodes  

## 4️⃣ Parent
- A node that has one or more children  

## 5️⃣ Child
- A node that descends from another node  

## 6️⃣ Siblings
- Nodes having the same parent  

## 7️⃣ Leaf (External Node)
- Node with no children  

## 8️⃣ Internal Node
- Any node with at least one child  
- All non-leaf nodes except root  

## 9️⃣ Ancestor
- Parent, grandparent, … up to the root  

## 🔟 Descendant
- Child, grandchild, … below a node  

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Degree
- **Degree of a node** → Number of children  
- **Degree of a tree** → Maximum degree of any node  

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Level
- Position of a node in the tree  
- Root is at **level 0** (sometimes level 1 — depends on definition)  

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Depth
- Number of edges from root to the node  
- Root depth = 0  

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Height
- Number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf  
- Height of tree = height of root  

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Path
- Sequence of nodes connected by edges  

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Subtree
- A node and all its descendants  

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Forest
- Collection of disjoint trees  
- Removing root of a tree creates a forest
