# Algorithms

## 1. WHAT

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures used to solve a problem or perform a task in a clear and logical way.

## 2. WHY

They solve the problem of inefficiency and inconsistency in problem-solving. Without algorithms, solutions become slow, error-prone, and hard to optimize or repeat.

## 3. WHERE

Algorithms sit inside the business logic layer of an application. They process data stored in data structures during request handling and help generate correct responses.

## 4. HOW

* First, the input data is taken and organized using suitable data structures.
* Next, a defined sequence of steps is applied to process the data.
* Finally, the algorithm produces the required output efficiently.

## 5. WHEN

* Algorithms should be used whenever a problem needs a clear, optimized, and repeatable solution.
* They should not be over-engineered for trivial tasks where simple logic is sufficient.

## 6. EXAMPLE

Using a binary search algorithm to quickly find a product ID in a sorted list instead of checking each item one by one.

## 7. PROS & CONS

**Pros:** Improve performance, reliability, and scalability of applications.

**Cons:** Complex algorithms can be harder to understand and may require more development time.

## 8. COMMON MISTAKES

* Choosing an algorithm without considering time or space complexity.
* Ignoring edge cases such as empty inputs or very large data sizes.
