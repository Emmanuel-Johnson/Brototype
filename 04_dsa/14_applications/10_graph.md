## ✅ Definition (1 line)

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (nodes)
connected by edges to represent relationships between entities.

## 🚀 3--5 Applications of Graph

-   Social networks
-   Shortest path algorithms (Google Maps)
-   Web page linking (Internet structure)
-   Network routing (Computer networks)
-   Dependency resolution (like course prerequisites)

## 🔎 Brief Explanation (1--2 Applications)

### 🌍 Social Networks

Each person is a vertex, and friendships are edges.

This helps platforms suggest friends, detect communities, and analyze
influence.

### 🗺 Shortest Path (Google Maps)

Cities are nodes and roads are edges with weights (distance/time).

Algorithms like Dijkstra's find the shortest route efficiently.
