## ✅ Definition (1 line)

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In,
First Out) principle, where insertion happens at the rear and deletion
happens at the front.

## 🚀 3--5 Applications of Queue

-   CPU scheduling
-   Printer spooling
-   Breadth-First Search (BFS)
-   Handling requests in web servers
-   Order processing systems (first come, first served)

## 🔎 Brief Explanation (1--2 Applications)

### 1️⃣ CPU Scheduling

Processes waiting for execution are stored in a queue.

The process that enters first gets executed first (FIFO principle).

### 2️⃣ Breadth-First Search (BFS)

In graphs and trees, BFS uses a queue to explore nodes level by level.

This ensures the closest nodes are visited first.
