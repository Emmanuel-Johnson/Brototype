## 🔎 Brief Explanation (1--2 Applications)

### 🗂 File System Organization

Operating systems organize files and folders in a tree structure.

There is a root directory, and inside it are subfolders and files ---
exactly like parent--child nodes.

### 🗄 Database Indexing

Databases use special trees (like B-Trees) to store data efficiently.

This allows searching, insertion, and deletion in O(log n) time.
