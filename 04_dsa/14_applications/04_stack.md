A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First
Out) principle, where insertion and deletion happen at one end called
the top.

## 🚀 3--5 Applications of Stack

-   Function calls (Call Stack)
-   Undo/Redo operations
-   Expression evaluation & syntax parsing
-   Backtracking algorithms (DFS, maze solving)
-   Parenthesis checking / balanced symbols

## 🔎 Brief Explanation (1--2 Applications)

### 1️⃣ Function Calls (Call Stack)

When a function is called, it is pushed onto the stack.
After execution, it is popped.

This is how recursion works internally.

### 2️⃣ Expression Evaluation

Stacks are used to evaluate expressions like:

-   Infix → Postfix conversion
-   Postfix evaluation (e.g., 2 3 +)

Very common in compiler design and calculators.
