# 🟢 Complete Graph

A **Complete Graph** is a graph where:

👉 Every vertex (node) is connected to every other vertex.  
No node is left out.  
Full connection. Maximum connections.

---

## 📌 Example: Complete Graph with 5 Nodes (K₅)

This graph is called:

**K₅**

- **K** → Complete graph  
- **5** → Number of vertices  

Every node connects to the other **4 nodes**.

## 🧠 Formula You Should Remember (Interview Gold)

For a complete graph with **n nodes**:

### 🔢 Number of edges:

\[
\frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

### Why?

Because every pair of nodes has exactly one edge.

---

### ✅ Example Calculations

- **K₄** → 4(3)/2 = **6 edges**
- **K₅** → 5(4)/2 = **10 edges**

## ⚡ Key Properties

- Very dense graph  
- Every node degree = **n − 1**  
- Always connected  
- Maximum possible edges in an undirected graph

## 💡 Real-life Intuition

Think of:

- A WhatsApp group where everyone has everyone’s number  
- A fully connected friend circle  
- Direct peer-to-peer network
